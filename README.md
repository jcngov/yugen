##Intro

Y큰gen derives from Japan meaning an awareness of the universe that triggers emotional responses too deep and mysterious for words.  Y큰gen is felt when you travel, where you immerse yourself in different cultures, encountering jaw-dropping sites, experimenting with exotic food, and meeting new people.  While everyones dream is to travel the world, there is uncertainty with traveling.  Travelers want to make sure that they're spending their money wisely, by going to the cool spots, trying out the best food, and being the most efficient they possibly can throughout the duration of their trip.  With the help of the web application: Y큰gen, users could create posts about their previous trips in order to help other users plan their trips and get helpful hints to make the most out of their travels!
